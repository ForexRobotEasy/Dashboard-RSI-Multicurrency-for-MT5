# Dashboard RSI Multicurrency for MT5

This is a code for a Dashboard RSI Multicurrency Expert Advisor for MetaTrader 5. The code allows you to monitor multiple currency pairs and timeframes using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator.

## Global Variables

- `RSI[]`: An array to store the RSI values for each currency pair and timeframe.
- `OverboughtLevel`: The RSI level considered as overbought.
- `OversoldLevel`: The RSI level considered as oversold.
- `AlertEnabled`: A boolean variable to enable or disable alerts.

## Expert Initialization Function

In the `OnInit()` function, the code sets up the currency pairs and timeframes to monitor. It initializes the RSI array and subscribes to the RSI indicator for each currency pair and timeframe. It also sets the indicator parameters such as the RSI period, applied price, level values, colors, width, style, and type. Finally, it adds the RSI indicators to the chart.

## Expert Deinitialization Function

In the `OnDeinit()` function, the code removes all RSI indicators from the chart. It loops through all objects on the chart and deletes the ones with names containing 'RSI'.

## Expert Tick Function

In the `OnTick()` function, the code updates the RSI values for each currency pair and timeframe. It then checks if the RSI values cross over the overbought and oversold levels. If an overbought or oversold condition is met and alerts are enabled, it sends an alert message.
